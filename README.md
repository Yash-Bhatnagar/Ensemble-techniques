# Ensemble-techniques
<h3>Business Context:</h3>

<h3>Solution Offered:</h3>
<p>This repository contains jupyter notebook which uses python3 to:</p>
<ul> 
<li>Predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit.</li>
<li>Compare the performance of various ML models(Decision tree,Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes)</li>
<li>Build various ensemble models 
<ol>
<li>Random forest</li>
<li>Bagging classifier</li>
<li>Adaboosting</li>
<li>Gradient boosting</li>
<li>Stacking classifier</li>
</ol>
And compare their performance
</li>
<li>And find out the best model which can be used in the given scenario</li>
</ul>
