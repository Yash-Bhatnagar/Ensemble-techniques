Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y='no'). 
Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed.
Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. 
Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.
